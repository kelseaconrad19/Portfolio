    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Hello! My name is Kelsea Conrad.</h2>
    <p>I am currently an English teacher, deeply passionate about serving my students to the best of my ability. With over 5 years of experience in education, I have honed a robust set of skills in communication, problem solving and critical thinking, project management, attention to detail, adaptability, collaboration, and empathy.</p>This portfolio is a curated collection of my most significant projects and accomplishments. Currently residing in Charleston, SC, I spend my time outside of work engaging with my church's youth group, taking my own three kids swimming, and reading fantasy novels. </p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I invite you to browse through my work and reach out with any questions or opportunities.</p>
