    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Kelsea Conrad, a former high school English teacher transitioning into the field of software development. My journey from the classroom to coding is driven by a passion for problem-solving and a fascination with technology's ability to transform how we learn, communicate, and interact with other humans in the world.</p>
        
    <h3>My Journey</h3>
        
    <p>After five years in education, I've developed a deep appreciation for clear communication, structured thinking, and empathetic engagement—skills that I now bring to software development. Teaching English not only honed my ability to explain complex ideas in an accessible way but also equipped me with the patience and detail orientation necessary for writing and debugging code.</p>
        
    <p>During my time as a teacher, I led several initiatives to integrate technology into our curriculum, which sparked my interest in software engineering. This led me to pursue further education in programming, where I learned Python3, OOP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I've since worked on projects involving building a variety of command-line games, library management systems, e-commerce database and management systems, and more.</p>
        
    <h3>My Skills and Expertise</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>
            <strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Creating lesson plans and educational programs that address varied learning needs has refined my ability to devise innovative solutions—now applied to developing software that is user-focused and effective.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Communication:</strong> Whether it's documenting code, presenting project updates, or collaborating with peers, I excel in sharing ideas clearly and persuasively.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Project Management:</strong> Managing classrooms and educational projects taught me how to keep complex projects on track and within deadlines, a skill that directly translates to software project management.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Staying updated with the latest educational practices has instilled a habit of lifelong learning, keeping me on the cutting edge of software development tools and practices.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
        
    <p>As I continue to blend my teaching experience with my technical skills, I am particularly interested in projects that enhance educational technologies and accessibility. I am eager to contribute to a team that values innovation, quality, and a user-centric approach to software development.</p>
